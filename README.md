Introduction:
The Decimal to Binary Converter is a simple command-line program written in C++. This program allows users to input a non-negative decimal number and converts it to its binary equivalent. The binary number system is a base-2 numeral system that uses only two symbols, typically 0 and 1, to represent numerical values. This conversion is fundamental in computer science and digital electronics.

Features:
Complexity: The time complexity of the program is O(log n).
Simple and Fast Conversion: Efficiently converts decimal numbers to binary.
User Input: Allows users to input any non-negative decimal number.
Error Handling: Checks for invalid inputs and provides appropriate messages.
